# BAR Hotkey Collection
This is central place to help people customize their keybinds for BAR. Originally it was just going to be for helping to solve conflicts between grid menu and BAR's default hotkeys, but a central repository to find and share keybinds will help a wider playerbase. The files here are intended to be resources that BAR players can see as examples to help customize their own hotkeys. Though some files you find might mostly work for drop-in, it's recommended that you customize based on a recent version from the main repo to make sure you are not missing important actions for interface functionality.
- The .png's are visual layouts of the grid optimized layout, available in-game.
- custom_army_selection is an amalgam of selection keys players have found useful.
- old files are incopmlete but may contain interesting binds.
- default, default60, grid_opti and grid_opti60 are from /keysave 1/17/23
- any .lua are for the LUA style config, currently loaded by the bar hotkey widget.
- refer to the HOWTO and FAQ as documentation, and come find us on the official BAR discord in #keybind-help.
