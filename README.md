# BAR_grid_uikeys
This is central place to help people customize their keybinds for BAR. Originally it was
just going to be for helping to solve conflicts between grid menu and BAR's default hotkeys,
but a central repository to find and share keybinds will help a wider playerbase. The files
here are intended to be resources that BAR players can see as examples to help customize
their own hotkeys, they are not intended as drop-in replacements for your current layout.

  -> The .png's are visual layouts of the grid optimized layout, available in-game.
  
  -> custom_army_selection is an amalgam of selection keys players have found useful.
  
  -> old files are incopmlete but may contain interesting binds.
  
  -> default, default60, grid_opti and grid_opti60 are from /keysave 1/17/23
  
  -> any .lua are for the LUA style config, currently loaded by the bar hotkey widget.
