# BAR_grid_uikeys
This is central place to help people customize their keybinds for BAR. Originally it was
just going to be for helping to solve conflicts between grid menu and BAR's default hotkeys,
but a central repository to find and share keybinds will help a wider playerbase.
Files maintained:
Default - the output from /keysave 22/11/2021
Organized Default - Keybinds reorganized into categories of some sort.
Grid Menu - a collection of keybind changes to help avoid conflicts with the default while using grid menu.
Camera anchors - reorganizes some keybinds to help accomodate the camera anchor widget for camera hotkeys.
Unit selection - A collection of custom unit selection keys.
